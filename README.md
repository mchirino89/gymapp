# ${1: GymApp}

This app gets workout exercises from [wger.de](https://wger.de/api/v2/) API and organize them in a very friendly way so it's really simple to start working out. Capstone final Udacity nanodegree project.

## Getting Started

All you need is a Macbook with Xcode installed, `pods` setup and an internet connection to test it out.

### Prerequisites

Xcode 8.3.3+
Pods

### Installing

After cloning the project, navigate to the root of and run `pod install` so the required pods are installed. 

## Usage

The usage of the app is really simple: it consists of only 3 tabs

1- **Muscle group classification**: in here you can select what muscle group would you like to see exercises for. For instance, you can start by clicking on _Abs_, then you'll be taken to another view and see all the workout availables for them; moreover you could tap for instance on _Crunches_ and finally you'd be taken to the detailed information of this exercises: a image or even a gif animation (if available in the API), the muscles this exercise involve, possible required equipment and a description at the bottom further explaining how to perform it.
2- **Routine**: this view consists on a serie of preloaded workouts for specific body zones, after selecting any of them you'll be taken to a view exactly a level 2 in the first app but now with a mixing of exercises based on your selection.
3- **Profile**: in this view you can save your personal information such as a profile picture, your full name, gender and body measures. This information will be used for further calculation in future versions of the app.

## History

The goal of this app a very simple one: make working out *EASY*, you don't need to have deep knowledge on human biology to execute a simple routine and sweat a little bit. This is dedicated to all those people who want to start a healthier life but the lack of help (or willing to look for it) is stoping them, go for it!
